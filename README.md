Predicting Health Insurance Charges:
This project focuses on predicting individual medical insurance charges using various machine learning models. We evaluate the performance of Linear Regression and Random Forest models and explore data distribution through visualizations.
Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to accurately predict insurance charges based on several demographic and health related features. We use different machine learning models to assess prediction accuracy and provide insights into key factors affecting insurance costs.
Data:
The dataset used in this project includes the following features:
•	Age: Age of the primary beneficiary
•	Sex: Gender of the insurance contractor (female, male)
•	BMI: Body Mass Index
•	Children: Number of dependents covered
•	Smoker: Smoking status (yes, no)
•	Region: Residential area (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest)
•	Charges: Medical costs billed by insurance

Libraries and Tools Used

•	Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
•	Scikitlearn: For machine learning models and preprocessing
•	Linear Regression
•	Random Forest
•	Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
•	Seaborn: For statistical data visualization
•	NumPy: For numerical operations
•	Jupyter Notebook: For interactive code execution
 Data Analysis Processes
Data Preparation:
•	Preprocessing features including scaling numerical values and onehot encoding categorical variables.
•	Splitting the data into training and testing sets.


Model Training and Evaluation:
•	Training and evaluating Linear Regression and Random Forest models.
•	Calculating performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and Rsquared.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
•	Analyzing the distribution of insurance charges.
•	Examining average insurance charges by gender and smoking status.

Visualization:
•	Creating histograms, bar charts, and pie charts to visualize data distribution and insights.

Results
 Model Performance:
•	Random Forest provided better prediction accuracy compared to Linear Regression.
Key Factors:
•	Smoking status, gender, and BMI significantly influence insurance charges.
